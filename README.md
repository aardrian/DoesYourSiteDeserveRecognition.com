# DoesYourSiteDeserveRecognition.com
Proposed baseline to consider before honoring, recognizing, or awarding a site.

Ideally this will be the baseline I would like to see anyone consider before deciding a site is worthy of an award or some similar form of recognition. This can apply to templates, themes, etc.

It will live at DoesYourSiteDeserveRecognition.com and DoesMySiteDeserveRecognition.com and I want to use it (and hopefully others will want to use it) as a place to send anyone who talks about some form of "awesome" site. Including me if I fall prey to new hotness.

I plan to include language to account for exceptions as there are some sites that intentionally break the rules as a way of moving the web forward, though those should be rare.
